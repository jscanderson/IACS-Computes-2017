    "Now let's take a closer look at some of the things we just did. We've been using the \"=\" to assign variables. This is called the assignment operator, and the way it's used is pretty important. In math, the purpose of the equal sign is a statement that two quantities are the same, which usually gives us some information to solve a problem. However, in programming, this is not the case. The assignment operator (=) is used to tell the computer to *do* something. When we use the assignment operator, we're telling the computer to take whatever is on the right-hand side of the equals sign, and put it in whatever is on the left. Therefore, the left- and right-hand sides of the equal sign are not the same in programming! In the quadratic example above, the computer created a variable called a, and then stored the value of 2 in a. It then did similarly for b, c, x1, and x2. Let's do some more examples:"
