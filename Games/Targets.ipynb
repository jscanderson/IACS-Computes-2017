    "This game takes a lot of code from the Molecular Dynamics 3 notebook. The object of this game is to fire a pellet from the center of the screen to hit a number of targets, all generated using Turtles. The player specifies the angle at which they want to fire the pellet, and has infinite tries.\n",
