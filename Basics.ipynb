The first is called \"markdown.\" Markdown cells, when executed (described below), simply become paragraphs of text (as if in a normal text editor such as Microsoft Word.) The second type of cell we will be using is code cells. Code cells, when executed, will run the code inside the cell. The easiest way to change the type of cell you are coding in is with the dropdown menu at the top of the screen. Keep note of this: one of the most common mistakes students have when beginning to use Jupyter notebooks is typing code into a markdown cell, or regular text into a code cell. This is easily fixed by changing the cell to the correct type."

For example if you are in command mode and you press c, you will copy the current cell."
