When we write \"for a in numlist:\" we're creating a new variable called a, and inside a, we store the first value inside numlist (which is 1). Then we move on to execute the indented code in the for loop. At the next iteration of the loop, the value inside a will be changed to be the next value inside numlist (in this case, 2). And this will continue until a takes on the value of the last element in numlist. Note that the variable name \"a\" is arbitrary. We could name this variable whatever we want, as long as we're consistent inside the loop. A common convention is to use a variable name that describes what is inside the list. For this loop, we could have used the variable name \"number\" since each thing inside numlist is a number.\n",
