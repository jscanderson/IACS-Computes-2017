An if statement checks some condition (for example, is a < 11 ?), and if it is true, then it executes a block of indented code underneath it. A while loop starts out the same. It checks some condition, and if it is true, it executes the block of code underneath. However, once that block is done, a while loop goes back and checks the condition again. If the condition is still true, it repeats the block of code underneath, and continues this cycle until the expression evaluates to false."
