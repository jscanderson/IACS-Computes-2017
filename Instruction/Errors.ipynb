    "I'm sure by now you've encountered an error or two when trying to run your programs. Up until now, an error would generally cause Python to cease execution of the program and print some kind of complaint to the screen, which is sometimes what we want the program to do, and sometimes not. These error messages can themselves be used to find out what is wrong with your program. When you encounter an error, don't panic. The best thing to do is to read the text of the error message and see if you can find any clues as to what went wrong in your code. After that, if you can't find it, try searching the internet. Nowadays, just about every error you encounter, somebody else has encountered before, and a solution may be found online."

However, if an exception occurs (as would happen if math.sqrt was given a negative number), it looks to see if we've given it a fall-back option in case that exception should occur, in the form of an except statement. To do this we write except and then the name of the error we're expecting (math.sqrt issues a ValueError if it encounters a negative number). The actual naming of the error is optional. If you just write \"except:\", then the code below it will be exectued if *any* exception occurs. You can even list multiple types of exceptions in a single except statement if you wish."
