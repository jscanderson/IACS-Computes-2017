It takes some number of raw ingredients, and spits out a finished product or products. We can give functions names just like we give variables names. The inputs that a function works with are normally written in parentheses after the name of the function. So let's say we have a function named f that takes 2 inputs, which we'll temporarily call a and b. Then we write f(a,b). f takes a and b and produces something."
