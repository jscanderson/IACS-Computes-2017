    "I'm sure by now you've encountered an error or two when trying to run your programs. Up until now, an error would generally cause Python to cease execution of the program and print some kind of complaint to the screen, which is sometimes what we want the program to do, and sometimes not. These error messages can themselves be used to find out what is wrong with your program. When you encounter an error, don't panic. The best thing to do is to read the text of the error message and see if you can find any clues as to what went wrong in your code. After that, if you can't find it, try searching the internet. Nowadays, just about every error you encounter, somebody else has encountered before, and a solution may be found online."

However, if an exception occurs (as would happen if math.sqrt was given a negative number), it looks to see if we've given it a fall-back option in case that exception should occur, in the form of an except statement. To do this we write except and then the name of the error we're expecting (math.sqrt issues a ValueError if it encounters a negative number). The actual naming of the error is optional. If you just write \"except:\", then the code below it will be exectued if *any* exception occurs. You can even list multiple types of exceptions in a single except statement if you wish."

    "There are two more possible keywords that can be used in a try block: the else keyword, and the finally keyword. They are not very common as they have very specific uses, but for any who are interested, I'll give a brief summary here. Anything in an else block of code will only be executed if the initial try block executed successfully (and not if the except block is what executed). Exceptions raised in the else block will *not* be caught by the except statement, which may be a good thing if you only want the except block to catch a very specific exception. The finally keyword is used to create a block of code that is executed whether or not an exception is raised. If an exception is raised that is caught by an except block, the finally block will run after the except block. If an exception is raised that is *not* caught by an except block, then the finally block will run *before* the exception is reported. In this way, it's sometimes used to \"sneak in\" code between the generation of an exception and the termination of the code execution."
